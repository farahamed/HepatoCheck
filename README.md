## Installation
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the application:
```
python main.py
```

## Application Features

HepatoCheck provides a user-facing Tkinter application for liver risk screening.

Main features include:

- Home page with project overview and navigation
- Single patient input form
- Input validation for missing or invalid clinical values
- Liver risk prediction using the trained machine learning model
- Result display page showing:
  - Risk classification
  - Model confidence
  - Low-risk and possible-risk probabilities
  - Abnormal lab value flags
  - Recommendation message
  - Top important model features
- Medical disclaimer page
- Batch CSV upload for multiple patient records
- Batch prediction table
- Export batch results to CSV
- Screening history page
- Export screening history to TXT
- Error handling for invalid inputs, missing files, and prediction issues

## Required Patient Inputs

For single-patient prediction and batch CSV prediction, the following input features are required:

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Age | Patient age |
| Sex | Patient biological sex, accepted values: `m`, `f`, `male`, `female` |
| ALB | Albumin |
| ALP | Alkaline phosphatase |
| ALT | Alanine aminotransferase |
| AST | Aspartate aminotransferase |
| BIL | Bilirubin |
| CHE | Cholinesterase |
| CHOL | Cholesterol |
| CREA | Creatinine |
| GGT | Gamma-glutamyl transferase |
| PROT | Total protein |

## Batch CSV Format

The batch upload page accepts CSV files containing the same required patient features.

```csv
Age,Sex,ALB,ALP,ALT,AST,BIL,CHE,CHOL,CREA,GGT,PROT

# 📦 Model Artifacts

| File | Description |
|------|------------|
| trained_model.pkl | Final RandomForest model |
| scaler.pkl | Feature scaler |
| feature_names.pkl | Ordered feature list |
| model_metrics.json | Evaluation metrics |
| best_pipeline.pkl | Full pipeline (SMOTE + RF) |
| advanced_metrics.json | Model comparison results |
| shap_pruned_pipeline.pkl | Reduced feature pipeline |

# Evaluation Strategy

- Stratified train/test split
- 5-Fold Cross Validation
- Nested Cross Validation for tuning
- ROC-AUC used as main metric
- Confusion matrix for classification performance

---

# Explainability

We used SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) to:

- Explain individual predictions
- Rank feature importance
- Visualize global model behavior


---

# Imbalance Handling

Because dataset is highly imbalanced:

- SMOTE applied on training data
- Class weights used in RandomForest
- Threshold tuned to 0.2 instead of 0.5
- Calibration applied for probability stability

---

# GUI System

The system includes:

### Input Form
- Patient data entry
- Validation & preprocessing

### Result View
- Risk label
- Confidence score
- Abnormal markers
- Top contributing features

---

# Key Outcome

HepatoCheck provides:
- High accuracy liver disease prediction
- Interpretable ML decisions
- Clinically meaningful outputs

---

# Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas / NumPy
- SHAP
- LightGBM
- CatBoost
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- Tkinter (GUI)
